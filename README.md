PostBox-Config
==============

userChrome.css for making PostBox a little more usable (probably works with ThunderBird too)

To use this stylesheet, place it here (you will need to create the "chrome" directory):

~/Library/Application Support/Postbox/Profiles/[something random].default/chrome/userChrome.css

Then restart PostBox
